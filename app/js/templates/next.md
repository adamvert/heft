Possible next steps:

* ability to search notes
* visual overview of all notes
* ability to create and put notes into multiple notebooks
* sync with existing note services (Evernote, Simplenote, iCloud, Dropbox)
* since none of these services will store the layout info for each note, a Heft sync service (with subscription fee?)
* more (sponsored?) themes for note layout
