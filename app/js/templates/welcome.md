Welcome to Heft

Note apps are functional, utilitarian and boring. They don't exactly resemble the bubbling ferment of inspiration that a proper notebook should be. 

**Heft** is different.

Every note you enter into it is immediately styled. Don't like the way it looks? Shake yr phone to restyle it. Keep shaking till you find a style you like. Try it now.

You can go to the next note by swiping this one to the left, or by tapping on the right of the screen. Except it turns out there is no next note. You'd better add one now. Swipe (or tap), enter something witty or important (using markdown for formatting), press "Done", then shake till you're happy.

Swipe (or tap) back and forth to peruse your notes. If you want to edit one, tap and hold. After editing, a note's appearance is labile again, until you turn the page.

To add a new note, swipe (or tap) through your notes to the end. **Heft** always starts up with the most recent note, so you're only one swipe away from recording that crucial insight.

This is an early beta of **Heft**, so if you have any bug reports, suggestions or complaints, please please *please* email me at [ab@adam-butler.com](mailto:ab@adam-butler.com). Thanks!
