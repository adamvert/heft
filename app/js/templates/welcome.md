Welcome to Heft

A good notebook is a crucible of creativity. But up till now, note apps have always been functional, utilitarian -- and boring.

**Heft** is different.

Every note you enter into it is immediately styled. Don't like the way it looks? Shake yr phone to restyle it. Keep shaking till you find a style you like. Try it now.

Swipe (or tap) back and forth to peruse your notes. Once you move away from a new note, its appearance is fixed, no matter how much you shake it.

If you want to edit a note, tap and hold. After editing, a note's appearance is labile again, until you move on to another note.

To add a new note, swipe (or tap) through your notes to the end. (From now on, **Heft** will alway start up showing the last note, so you're only one swipe away from recording that crucial insight.)

This is an early beta of **Heft**, so if you have any bug reports, suggestions or complaints, please please *please* email me at [ab@adam-butler.com](mailto:ab@adam-butler.com). Thanks!
